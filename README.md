# stockopt

This repository provides a minimalistic stock sale planning tool.  Given a
report of the current trading price of a collection of shares, the tool chooses
which shares to sell to maximize the value obtained at that price respecting a
user-specified maximum value of capital gains.

Shares are partitioned into groups by their cost basis (typically reflecting
when they were obtained).
